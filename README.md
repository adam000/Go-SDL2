Go-SDL2 is a collection of packages for Go bindings for the
[Simple DirectMedia Layer](http://libsdl.org) version 2, known as "SDL2".

These bindings aim to be very Go-idiomatic and intuitive, and will include
bindings for SDL packages such as SDL-ttf, SDL-image, and more.

Examples of how to use these packages are available
[here](https://github.com/adam000/go-sdl-gl-examples).
